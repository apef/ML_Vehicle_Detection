I am a Brave Verified Creator on Github.  If you would like to support my work on this and other projects, you can make a donation in BAT using the Brave browser.  If you are using Brave, look for the triangle logo at the right end of the address bar.  (If you are not using Brave, consider switching browsers, for the benefit of your own privacy.)  Click that when you are on any of my Github projects, and it will give you an option to "SEND A TIP" or set a monthly contribution.  (Note that if you are viewing a fork of this project, you will be donating to the owner of the fork and not the original author.  When you click the Brave triangle icon, it will tell you who you are donating to.  Make sure it is the person you intend on supporting.  If you want to donate to the original author of pyRTOS, go to https://github.com/Rybec, and then click the triangle and submit the donation.)

If you do not have/want Brave or otherwise do not want to donate in BAT, I also have a Patreon account where you can contribute to this and other open source software and hardware projects.  This can be found here: https://www.patreon.com/techniumadeptus

These are currently the only ways I accept donations.  If there is ever enough demand, I am willing to add options to donate in certain cryptocurrencies.
