# ML_Vehicle_Detection
This project serves as a proof of concept for using Machine Learning on embedded devices. The aim is that the models should be able to detect and classify vehicles.

## Coral Dev Board Micro

### Software

The machine learning object detection model is a SSD MobileNetV2 trained on images of vehicles.

### Hardware

Dev Board Micro with integrated camera and Coral TPU.

## Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

### Software

The object detection model chosen for the raspberry pi is a vertex AI AutoML object detection model that was exported to a tensorflow lite model for edge devices

### Hardware

Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

WebCam

Coral USB Accelerator

LoRaWAN M5 stick
